[{"permalink":"//","layout":"default","title":"OpenUxAS","content":"# OpenUxAS\n\nThe Unmanned Systems Autonomy Services (UxAS) is a service-oriented software framework for mission-level autonomy for teams of unmanned vehicles. Though its primary focus is unmanned air vehicles, the \"x\" in the name indicates support for other types of unmanned systems. UxAS was developed at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) based on over 10 years of flight testing, and portions of UxAS are available open source on GitHub as OpenUxAS. \n\n## An Example\n\nA common use case for OpenUxAS is to optimally distribute surveillance tasks across a team of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). The goal of a UAV surveillance task is to sweep the sensor footprint of a UAV over a point, line, or the entirety of an area, possibly with task-dependent constraints on factors such as desired ground sample distance, angle of approach, view angle, standoff distance, and which UAVs are eligible to perform which tasks. Most of the time, tasks are underconstrained so that there are many options for how they can be carried out. \n\n\n\n","dir":"/","name":"README.md","path":"README.md","url":"/"},{"sort":1,"layout":"default","title":"Introduction","content":"<h1 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"design-principles\">Design Principles</h2>\n\n","dir":"/documentation/","name":"Introduction.md","path":"documentation/Introduction.md","url":"/documentation/Introduction.html"},{"sort":1,"permalink":"/documentation/","layout":"default","title":"Documentation","content":"<h1 id=\"documentation\">Documentation</h1>\n\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"/documentation/Introduction.html\">Introduction</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"/documentation/supportingSoftware.html\">Supporting Software</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"/documentation/Installation.html\">Installation</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"/documentation/contributing.html\">Contributing</a></li>\n</ul>\n","dir":"/documentation/","name":"README.md","path":"documentation/README.md","url":"/documentation/"},{"sort":1,"layout":"default","title":"Creating UxAS examples","content":"<h1 id=\"creating-uxas-examples\">Creating UxAS examples</h1>\n<h2 id=\"with-a-single-uxas-entity\">With a single UxAS entity</h2>\n<h2 id=\"with-multiple-uxas-entities\">With multiple UxAS entities</h2>\n<h2 id=\"with-amase\">With AMASE</h2>\n<h2 id=\"with-other-applications\">With other applications</h2>\n","dir":"/tutorials/","name":"createExamples.md","path":"tutorials/createExamples.md","url":"/tutorials/createExamples.html"},{"sort":2,"layout":"default","title":"Supporting Software","content":"# Supporting Software\n\n## External Applications\n\n## C++ 3rd Party Dependencies\n","dir":"/documentation/","name":"supportingSoftware.md","path":"documentation/supportingSoftware.md","url":"/documentation/supportingSoftware.html"},{"sort":2,"permalink":"/tutorials/","layout":"default","title":"Tutorials","content":"<h1 id=\"tutorials\">Tutorials</h1>\n\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"/tutorials/createExamples.html\">Creating UxAS examples</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"/tutorials/addService.html\">Adding a service</a></li>\n</ul>\n","dir":"/tutorials/","name":"README.md","path":"tutorials/README.md","url":"/tutorials/"},{"sort":2,"layout":"default","title":"Adding a service","content":"<h1 id=\"adding-a-service\">Adding a service</h1>\n<h2 id=\"in-c\">In C++</h2>\n<h2 id=\"with-a-3rd-party-dependency\">With a 3rd party dependency</h2>\n<h2 id=\"in-sparkada\">In SPARK/Ada</h2>\n<h2 id=\"in-other-languages\">In other languages</h2>\n<h2 id=\"adding-a-task-service\">Adding a task service</h2>\n","dir":"/tutorials/","name":"addService.md","path":"tutorials/addService.md","url":"/tutorials/addService.html"},{"sort":3,"layout":"default","title":"Installation","content":"<h1 id=\"installation\">Installation</h1>\n\n<h2 id=\"using-anod\">Using anod</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"manually\">Manually</h2>\n","dir":"/documentation/","name":"Installation.md","path":"documentation/Installation.md","url":"/documentation/Installation.html"},{"sort":3,"layout":"default","title":"Contributing","content":"<h1 id=\"contributing\">Contributing</h1>\n<h2 id=\"github-workflow\">GitHub Workflow</h2>\n<h2 id=\"standards-and-conventions\">Standards and Conventions</h2>\n<h2 id=\"continuous-integration\">Continuous Integration</h2>\n<h3 id=\"build-process\">Build process</h3>\n<h3 id=\"proof\">Proof</h3>\n","dir":"/documentation/","name":"contributing.md","path":"documentation/contributing.md","url":"/documentation/contributing.html"}]
